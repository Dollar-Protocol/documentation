# Rebasing

Anyone can execute a rebase on Dollar Protocol. The execution is allowed at certain times of the day \([see governance parameters](https://docs.dollarprotocol.com/governance/parameters)\).

Calling rebase pays the caller 100 USDx to compensate them for the transaction.

Please note: the rebase transaction is a bit expensive so be sure to set the gas limit \(**not gas price**\) to around 2M GWEI as an upper bound. The actual limit is around 1.5M GWEI but this may increase as more assets are added to the ecosystem.
