Share represents the governance token over the Dollar Protocol and subsequent synthetic ecosystems. It has the power to make proposals, delegate votes and vote, pass and execute protocol level amendments.

### Staking

NOTE: Staking will go live on 1/3/2020 5pm UTC. Be sure to stake your SHARE beforehand using the UI at [https://dollarprotocol/\#/stake](https://www.dollarprotocol/#/stake) so you are ready for the rewards.

Staking SHARE is a new governance proposal that passed recently. This proposal will give seigniorage profits for SHARE only to staked SHARE. 

The reward payout will still be pro-rata. Specifically, it will use the full total supply of 21M SHARE as the pro-rata denominator. This means part of the 21M SHARE seigniorage will be distributed to staked users, and the unstaked half will be burned. Over time, the market price of USDx will account for and balance out.

Unstaking Share is a 2 step process.

1. Commit to unstake \(3 days\). During this 3 day process, you will not receive any seigniorage reward. This timelock is to encourage users to remain staked.
2. After the 3 day minimum has been met, users can fully unstake and start to trade, send or provide liquidity using Share.

The 3 day minimum is also a governance parameter.

* Staking Share locks any Share in your own wallet. If other users send you Share, it is automatically added to your Stake
* Staked Share still has the ability to delegate and vote

### FAQs

**Why doesn't Staking Share send it to another contract?**

The biggest reason why staking Shares isn't sent to another contract is that it will complicate the delegating / voting process. Staking's main benefit is that it causes Shares to be more scarce, as well as protecting against users who buy Shares just for gaming positive rebase periods for 15 minutes at a time.

In this sense, staking is more akin to locking.
