Share represents the governance token over the Dollar Protocol and subsequent synthetic ecosystems. It has the power to make proposals, delegate votes and vote, pass and execute protocol level amendments.

It also has the ability to receive gas-less seigniorage from any of the synthetic tokens in the Dollar Protocol ecosystem.

### FAQs

**I don't see my reward from holding Share? Where did it go?**

The best way to see your reward is to connect your wallet to dollarprotocol.com and see the dashboard.

The second best way is to use a wallet like TrustWallet, which updates the balance in real time. You must remember to add the reward asset \(such as USDx\) by contract into the wallet as a custom token to register the new balance.

MetaMask is a bit slow in our experience so don't be afraid if you don't see a reward immedietly.

If everything else fails, send yourself a transaction for 0 Share, which will cause a state change and show you your rewards via transaction.
