# Share

![](../.gitbook/assets/share_bg.png)

Share represents the governance token over the Dollar Protocol and subsequent synthetic ecosystems. It has the power to make proposals, delegate votes and vote, pass and execute protocol level amendments.

It also has the ability to receive gas-less seigniorage from any of the synthetic tokens in the Dollar Protocol ecosystem.

### Staking

NOTE: Staking will go live on 1/3/2020 5pm UTC. Be sure to stake your SHARE beforehand using the UI at [https://dollarprotocol/\#/stake](https://www.dollarprotocol/#/stake) so you are ready for the rewards.

Staking SHARE is a new governance proposal that passed recently. This proposal will give seigniorage profits for SHARE only to staked SHARE. 

The reward payout will still be pro-rata. Specifically, it will use the full total supply of 21M SHARE as the pro-rata denominator. This means part of the 21M SHARE seigniorage will be distributed to staked users, and the unstaked half will be burned. Over time, the market price of USDx will account for and balance out.

Unstaking Share is a 2 step process.

1. Commit to unstake \(3 days\). During this 3 day process, you will not receive any seigniorage reward. This timelock is to encourage users to remain staked.
2. After the 3 day minimum has been met, users can fully unstake and start to trade, send or provide liquidity using Share.

The 3 day minimum is also a governance parameter.

### FAQs

**I don't see my reward from holding Share? Where did it go?**

The best way to see your reward is to connect your wallet to dollarprotocol.com and see the dashboard.

The second best way is to use a wallet like TrustWallet, which updates the balance in real time. You must remember to add the reward asset \(such as USDx\) by contract into the wallet as a custom token to register the new balance.

MetaMask is a bit slow in our experience so don't be afraid if you don't see a reward immedietly.

If everything else fails, send yourself a transaction for 0 Share, which will cause a state change and show you your rewards via transaction.
