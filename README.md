# Dollar Protocol

## What is Dollar Protocol?

Dollar Protocol is a suite of algorithmic synthetic assets governed by Share holders. Seigniorage Shares \([SHARE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x39795344CBCc76cC3Fb94B9D1b15C23c2070C66D)\) is an [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) token that simultaneously gives its holders on-chain voting rights to make protocol amendements and upgrades, as well as receiving [seigniorage profits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seigniorage.asp).

SHARE holders govern a suite of algorithmic synthetic assets, including [USD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2f6081e3552b1c86ce4479b80062a1dda8ef23e3), EUR, and YUAN. These stablecoins self-stabilize using protocol-enabled supply expansions and contractions around a Time Weighted Average Price \(TWAP\) oracle from the incentivized trading pool on Uniswap.

As of 12/29/2020, only USD is live. EUR and YUAN will be launched after certain milestones have been met in 2021.
