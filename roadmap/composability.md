# Composability

Currently, Dollar Protocol is not composable. This is because we are in a bootstrapping and experimental phase.

However, due to the attractive nature of xBond for each ecosystem, it may be possible at some future point to remove the debase quality of USDx and the other tokens \(EUR, YUAN\).

Think of the debase as "training wheels" while the protocol establishes the stability factor.

In addition, it is also possible to convert the airdrop of assets to SHARE holders to a staking model, where staked SHARE earn rewards.

These items are all in queue as the protocol matures.
